# Critical Questions for Hello Commerce â†’ Hello Theme Workflow Clone

## Overview
Before proceeding with the workflow cloning, these critical questions must be answered to ensure successful implementation. Each question impacts the implementation approach and requires stakeholder input.

---

## 1. Build Process Strategy Questions

### Q1: Build Action Replacement Strategy
**Context:** Hello Theme has a more sophisticated build-theme action with retry logic and error handling, while Hello Commerce has a simpler approach.

**Question:** Should we:
- **Option A:** Replace Hello Theme's build-theme action with Hello Commerce version?
- **Option B:** Keep Hello Theme's build-theme action and adapt Hello Commerce workflow to use it?
- **Option C:** Merge the best features from both actions?

**Current State:**
- Hello Theme: 72-line sophisticated build action with retry logic
- Hello Commerce: 68-line simpler build action  

**Impact:** Medium - affects build reliability and error handling

**Recommendation:** Option B - Keep Hello Theme's superior build action

HVV: For all duplicate files or folder names, add the suffix '-release', e.g. 'build-theme-release'. Use the workflows and actions from Hello Commerce if possible. Logic: I would like to clone existing files as much possible, so that we can't break the workflows with new implementations.

---

### Q2: Build Script Naming Strategy
**Context:** Different script names between repositories

**Hello Theme:** `npm run zip` (creates hello-elementor-{version}.zip)  
**Hello Commerce:** `npm run package:zip` (creates hello-commerce-{version}.zip)

**Question:** Should we:
- **Option A:** Update Hello Theme package.json to use `package:zip` script name?
- **Option B:** Adapt workflow to use Hello Theme's `zip` script?
- **Option C:** Create alias script for backward compatibility?

**Impact:** Low - cosmetic change but affects script consistency

**Recommendation:** Option B - Use Hello Theme's existing script names

HVV: Use option A. Add the option to use 'package:zip'. Don't remove any existing options.

---

## 2. Version Management Integration Questions

### Q3: Version Management Approach
**Context:** Two different approaches for version management

**Hello Theme Current:** JavaScript-based `update-version-in-files.js`
- Updates: `assets/scss/style.scss`, `functions.php`, `readme.txt`
- Uses replace-in-file package
- Already integrated into existing workflows

**Hello Commerce:** Bash-based approach in GitHub Actions
- Updates: `package.json`, `functions.php`, `style.css`, `readme.txt`
- Uses sed commands
- Integrated into release-preparation workflow

**Question:** Should we:
- **Option A:** Replace Hello Theme's JS approach with Hello Commerce bash approach?
- **Option B:** Keep Hello Theme's JS approach and adapt GitHub Actions to call it?
- **Option C:** Hybrid approach - use bash for some files, JS for SCSS-specific files?

**Impact:** High - affects version synchronization reliability

**Recommendation:** Option B - Keep Hello Theme's existing approach for continuity

HVV: Option A. But don't delete any existing functionality.

---

### Q4: SCSS File Version Management
**Context:** Hello Theme has `assets/scss/style.scss` that needs version management

**Question:** How should version updates be handled for SCSS files?
- **Option A:** Add SCSS handling to Hello Commerce's bash approach
- **Option B:** Keep Hello Theme's JS approach which already handles SCSS
- **Option C:** Manual SCSS version management (not recommended)

**Current Hello Theme JS script updates:**
```javascript
files: './assets/scss/style.scss',
from: /Version:.*$/m,
to: `Version: ${ VERSION }`,
```

**Impact:** High - SCSS files must have correct versions for WordPress.org compliance

**Recommendation:** Option B - Leverage existing JS script capability

HVV: Use option A.

---

## 3. Repository and Theme Naming Questions

### Q5: Theme Display Name Confirmation
**Context:** Repository name vs theme display name confusion

**Repository:** `elementor/hello-theme`  
**Theme Name:** "Hello Elementor"  
**Package Name:** `hello-elementor`  
**Build Artifact:** `hello-elementor-{version}.zip`

**Question:** Confirm the correct naming for all workflow messages:
- Slack notifications should say "Hello Elementor" (not "Hello Theme")?
- Build artifacts should be named `hello-elementor-{version}.zip`?
- WordPress.org references should use `hello-elementor`?

**Impact:** Medium - affects user communication and artifact naming

**Recommendation:** Use "Hello Elementor" for all user-facing messages

HVV: Compary with the 'Publish Release Version' workflow.
'hello-elementor' seems correct.
WordPress url: https://en-za.wordpress.org/themes/hello-elementor/
Github url: https://github.com/elementor/hello-theme

---

### Q6: Repository Reference Strategy
**Context:** GitHub repository references throughout workflow

**Question:** Should workflow references point to:
- **Option A:** `elementor/hello-theme` (actual repository)
- **Option B:** Update any hardcoded references to be dynamic
- **Option C:** Mix of repository and theme names where contextually appropriate

**Examples:**
- GitHub release URLs: `github.com/elementor/hello-theme/releases`
- Action references: `.github/actions/build-theme` (repository context)
- Theme references: WordPress.org URLs use `hello-elementor`

**Impact:** Low - mainly affects URLs and references

**Recommendation:** Option A - Use actual repository name for all GitHub references

HVV: Option A.
