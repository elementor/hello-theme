-# GitHub Workflows and Actions YAML Rules for Hello Theme
-
-## Core Principles
-
-### Assume Happy Path
-- Remove defensive checks that add little value
-- Assume branches exist, labels are correct, and operations succeed
-- Let failures fail naturally rather than adding extensive error handling
-- Focus on core functionality, not edge case handling
-
-### Keep Workflows Concise
-- Target 50-100 lines per workflow file
-- Extract complex logic to reusable scripts in `.github/scripts/`
-- Inline simple logic (templates, simple string operations)
-- Remove debugging and verbose logging
-
-### No Emojis
-- Never use emojis in workflow files, PR titles, or messages
-- Use plain text for all output and notifications
-
-## Script Extraction Guidelines
-
-### Extract to Scripts When:
-- Logic is complex (5+ lines of bash)
-- Logic is reused in multiple places
-- Logic benefits from testing independently
-
-### Keep Inline When:
-- Simple template strings
-- Single-line operations
-- Direct GitHub Actions expressions
-
-## Workflow Structure
-
-### Essential Steps Only
-- Checkout repository
-- Core workflow logic
-- Error handling only for critical failures
-
-### Remove These Steps:
-- Debugging/logging steps
-- Redundant validation steps
-- Conflict marker detection (redundant)
-
-## Code Style
-
-### YAML Formatting
-- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)
-- Keep line length reasonable (max 120 characters)
-- Use multi-line strings for readability when needed
-- Empty line at end of file
-
-## Examples
-
-### Bad: Debugging Clutter
-```yaml
-- name: Log trigger and PR information
-  run: |
-    echo "Trigger: ${{ github.event.action }}"
-    echo "PR #${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}"
-    # ... more debugging output
-```
-
-### Bad: Unnecessary Validation
-```yaml
-if [ ! -f "style.css" ]; then
-  echo "::error:: Missing style.css"
-  continue
-fi
-# Assume happy path - these checks add little value
-```

-
-                  This cherry-pick of [#${PR_NUMBER}](${ORIG_URL}) to \`${TARGET}\` branch has conflicts that need manual resolution.
-
-                  **Theme-Specific Conflict Resolution:**
-                  - **Version Conflicts**: Check \`style.css\` header for version mismatches
-                  - **Schema Conflicts**: Validate \`theme.json\` structure changes
-                  - **Function Conflicts**: Resolve \`functions.php\` function name collisions
-
-                  **Resolution Steps:**
-                  1. Check out this branch: \`git checkout $CONFLICT_BRANCH\`
-                  2. Resolve conflicts in the marked files
-                  3. Stage resolved files: \`git add <resolved-files>\`
-                  4. Amend the commit: \`git commit --amend\`
-                  5. Push changes: \`git push --force-with-lease\`
-                  6. Mark this PR as ready for review
-
-                  **Automatic Validation:**
-                  Once you push resolved changes, the following workflows will run automatically:
-                  - Build validation (\`build.yml\`)
-                  - JavaScript linting (\`lint.yml\`)
-                  - Cherry-pick validation (\`cherry-pick-validation.yml\`)
-                  - Additional CI workflows as configured

-# 🧪 Hello Theme Daily Test Matrix
-# 
-# This workflow runs daily automated testing across different version combinations:
-# - Core Matrix: Hello Theme × Elementor versions  
-# - Plus Matrix: Hello Theme × Hello Plus versions
-# - By default tests main branches (cutting-edge compatibility)
-# - Can be manually triggered with specific versions for release testing
-#
-# Each matrix workflow handles its own version calculation and testing logic.
-#
-# 📊 Targeted Matrix Generation:
-#
-# Hello Theme × Elementor:
-# - Hello Theme (main) × Elementor (main, previous GA minor.x, previous-previous GA minor.x)
-# - Hello Theme (ga, if exists) × Elementor (main, previous GA minor.x, previous-previous GA minor.x)
-#
-# Hello Theme × Hello Plus:
-# - Hello Theme (main) × Hello Plus (latest, previous patch - WordPress.org releases only)
-# - Hello Theme (ga, if exists) × Hello Plus (latest, previous patch - WordPress.org releases only)
-#
-# Example Output (HT GA=3.4.4, EL latest=3.30.4, HP latest=1.7.2):
-# [

+# Changelog
+
+All notable changes to **Hello 420** are documented in this file.
+
+This project follows a patch-based workflow during 2.2.x (2.2.1-dev, 2.2.2-dev, ...).
+
+## [2.2.1-dev] - 2026-01-06
+
+### Added
+- Minimal runtime assets under `/assets/` (CSS, JS, SVG) so the theme works without a build step.
+- Lightweight script loader (`includes/script.php`) that does not require `*.asset.php` files.
+- Admin Home REST endpoints (`hello420/v1/...`) and minimal UI scripts for Home/Settings/Top Bar.
+- `languages/hello420.pot` placeholder (regen when strings change).
+
+### Changed
+- Theme metadata updated to Hello 420 (slug `hello420`, author `coletivo 420`, textdomain `hello420`).
+- PHP requirement raised to **8.2+** (enforced on activation).
+- Elementor Header/Footer experiment feature id renamed to `hello420-header-footer`.
+- Replaced remaining legacy page-title filter usage with `hello420_page_title`.
+
+### Removed
+- Marketing/telemetry endpoints and files (promotions, "what's new", and related references).
+- External redirects and unused external references (kept Elementor internal URLs).
+- `screenshot.png` from theme root.
+- Build/test toolchain files that are not required for runtime.
+- Unused npm configuration (`.npmrc`).
+
+### Fixed
+- Prevented fatal errors when admin scripts are referenced but not built.
+- Updated dynamic header/footer templates to use Hello 420 settings helpers.
+

-# Hello Elementor
+# Hello 420
 
-A lightweight and minimalist WordPress theme for Elementor site builder.
+Hello 420 is a lightweight, minimalist WordPress theme built to work seamlessly with **Elementor**.
 
-<p><a href="https://elementor.com/?utm_source=github-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=readme"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/themes.svn.wordpress.org/hello-elementor/2.7.1/screenshot.png?w=600&strip=all" alt="Hello Elementor"></a></p>
+The 2.2.x series is focused on:
+- Maintaining a clean, stable fork-based codebase
+- Removing marketing/telemetry
+- Improving i18n and documentation for human + AI contributors
 
-## Description
+## Requirements
 
-[Hello Elementor](https://elementor.com/products/hello-theme/?utm_source=github-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=readme) is a lightweight and minimalist WordPress theme that was built specifically to work seamlessly with the [Elementor site builder](https://elementor.com/?utm_source=github-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=readme) plugin. The theme is free, open-source, and designed for users who want a flexible, easy-to-use, and customizable website.
+- WordPress: 6.0+
+- PHP: 8.2+
+- Elementor: recommended (required to unlock theme builder and Site Settings integrations)
 
-The theme's main focus is on providing a solid foundation for users to build their own unique designs using the Elementor drag-and-drop site builder. It is optimized for speed and performance, and its simplicity and flexibility make it a great choice for both beginners and experienced website designers.
+## Key features
 
-The theme supports common WordPress features which can be extended using a child-theme. In addition, there are several ways to add custom styles. It can be done from **Elementor**, using a child-theme, or with an external plugin. To customize the theme further, visit [Elementor developers docs](https://developers.elementor.com/docs/hello-elementor-theme/).
+- Minimal front-end styles (Elementor-first)
+- Header & footer controls inside Elementor Site Settings
+- Customizer fallback action-links when Elementor is not active
+- Admin Home (modern WP UI) with internal shortcuts and REST endpoints

+# AI-oriented documentation
+
+This directory explains how **Hello 420** works in a way that is easy to:
+- review
+- patch
+- refactor safely
+
+## Rules (always)
+
+1. Keep the theme functional at all times (each patch version must load in WP without fatal errors).
+2. Avoid reintroducing build-time requirements for runtime behavior.
+3. Always update and review:
+   - `docs/` (this folder)
+   - `CHANGELOG.md`
+   whenever any code changes.
+
+## Quick map
+
+- `functions.php`: core constants, theme supports, front-end styles, and bootstrapping.
+- `theme.php`: singleton + autoloader + module initialization.
+- `includes/`: helpers (script loader, utils, elementor helpers, customizer, settings tabs).
+- `modules/admin-home/`: admin UI (menu, top bar, settings UI) and REST endpoints.
+- `assets/`: runtime CSS/JS (no build step required).

+# AI Contributor Rules (Hello 420)
+
+These rules apply to every 2.2.x patch.
+
+## Non-negotiables
+
+- Keep the theme functional at every patch version.
+- Avoid re-introducing build steps (no npm/webpack required for runtime).
+- Do not add custom features from previous Hello 420 versions in 2.2.x unless explicitly planned.
+- Always update and review **DOCS** and **CHANGELOG** whenever code changes.
+
+## Documentation workflow
+
+When editing any PHP/JS/CSS that changes behavior:
+1. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with the patch note.
+2. Update the relevant AI docs under `docs/ai/`.
+3. Run PHP lint (`php -l`) on edited files.
+
+## Patch workflow
+
+- Patch versions: `2.2.(N)-dev`
+- Prefer small, reviewable commits.
+- Use `git format-patch` to produce distributable patchdiff files.

+## High-level goals
+
+Hello 420 is Elementor-first. The theme keeps front-end styles minimal and focuses on providing a stable base for Elementor sites.
+
+## Entry points
+
+- `functions.php`
+  - Defines constants
+  - Registers theme supports
+  - Boots the theme modules via `theme.php`
+
+- `theme.php`
+  - Registers an autoloader for the `Hello420Theme\` namespace
+  - Initializes modules (currently Admin Home)
+
+## Modules
+
+Modules live under `/modules/*` and extend `Hello420Theme\Includes\Module_Base`.
+
+Current module:
+- `modules/admin-home/`
+  - Adds the **Hello 420** admin menu and a modern UI
+  - Provides REST endpoints under `hello420/v1/*`
+
+## Assets
+
+Runtime assets live in `/assets/` and are intentionally minimal.
+
+- Front-end CSS is enqueued from `functions.php`
+- Elementor editor/preview JS is enqueued from `includes/elementor-functions.php`
+- Admin Home scripts are enqueued via `Hello420Theme\Includes\Script`

+# Contribution rules (AI + human)
+
+## Stability first
+
+- Do not introduce fatals, missing function calls, or missing includes.
+- If a change is risky, land it in a separate patch with clear notes.
+
+## Patch workflow (2.2.x)
+
+- Every patch must bump the version in `style.css` and `functions.php`.
+- Every patch must update `CHANGELOG.md`.
+- Keep patches small and reviewable.
+
+## i18n
+
+- All UI strings must use the `hello420` text domain.
+- Prefer:
+  - `esc_html__()` for plain text
+  - `esc_attr__()` for attributes
+  - `wp_kses_post()` for safe HTML fragments
+
+## External links policy
+
+- Prefer WordPress internal admin URLs.
+- Elementor internal URLs are allowed.
+- Avoid marketing, tracking, telemetry, and external redirectors.
+
+## No legacy re-implementation in 2.2.1
+
+The 2.2.x branch focuses on refactoring and documentation. Custom features from older Hello 420 versions should be reintroduced only in later patches and only after the fork is stable.

+# Admin Home (Modern UI)
+
+## Purpose
+
+Provide a fast, internal-only dashboard for theme shortcuts without requiring a build step.
+
+## Screens
+
+- Home: `admin.php?page=hello420`
+- Settings: `admin.php?page=hello420-settings`
+
+## REST API
+
+Namespace: `hello420/v1`
+
+- `GET /admin-settings`
+  - returns admin UI config: quick links, site parts, resources
+
+- `GET /theme-settings`
+  - returns boolean theme settings
+
+- `POST /theme-settings`
+  - accepts `{ settings: { KEY: boolean } }`
+
+## JS constraints
+
+- Must work without a build step.
+- Prefer WordPress packages: `wp.element`, `wp.i18n`, `wp.apiFetch`.
+- If `wp.apiFetch` is unavailable, use `fetch()` with the REST nonce provided by the theme bootstrap.

+# Architecture
+
+## Boot flow
+
+1. WordPress loads `functions.php`.
+2. Theme constants are defined (`HELLO420_*`).
+3. Base supports and styles are registered.
+4. Elementor helpers are loaded (`includes/elementor-functions.php`).
+5. The main singleton is loaded (`theme.php` → `Hello420Theme\Theme`).
+6. Modules are initialized (currently: Admin Home).
+
+## Autoloader
+
+`theme.php` registers a simple PSR-0-like autoloader.
+
+Examples:
+- `Hello420Theme\Includes\Utils` → `includes/utils.php`
+- `Hello420Theme\Modules\AdminHome\Module` → `modules/admin-home/module.php`
+
+## Module system
+
+Modules extend `includes/module-base.php`.
+
+Each module provides a list of component IDs, which are instantiated.
+
+Current modules:
+- `modules/admin-home/`
+
+## Theme templates
+
+- Root templates (`header.php`, `footer.php`) call template parts.
+- Dynamic header/footer parts use Elementor kit settings via helpers in `includes/elementor-functions.php`.
+

+# Admin Home & Settings
+
+## Menu
+
+- Main admin menu: **Hello 420** (`admin.php?page=hello420`)
+- Settings: `admin.php?page=hello420-settings`
+- Theme Builder shortcut (internal Elementor URL): `admin.php?page=hello420-theme-builder` redirects.
+
+## REST API
+
+Namespace: `hello420/v1`
+
+Endpoints:
+- `GET /admin-settings` → returns config used by Admin Home UI
+- `GET /theme-settings` → returns toggle settings
+- `POST /theme-settings` → updates toggle settings
+
+All endpoints require `manage_options`.
+
+## JS files
+
+Runtime scripts live in `assets/js/...` and are loaded via `includes/script.php`.
+
+- `hello420-admin-home.js` → renders the Admin Home page
+- `hello420-settings.js` → renders the Settings page
+- `hello420-topbar.js` → renders a minimal top bar on theme pages
+
+## Design note
+
+The admin UI is intentionally minimal in 2.2.1-dev to avoid a build step. It can be expanded in future patches, but should stay functional even if assets are missing.

 == Description ==
 
-Hello Elementor is a lightweight and minimalist WordPress theme that was built specifically to work seamlessly with the Elementor site builder plugin. The theme is free, open-source, and designed for users who want a flexible, easy-to-use, and customizable website.
-
-The theme's main focus is on providing a solid foundation for users to build their own unique designs using the Elementor drag-and-drop site builder. It is optimized for speed and performance, and its simplicity and flexibility make it a great choice for both beginners and experienced website designers.
-
-The theme supports common WordPress features which can be extended using a child-theme. In addition, there are several ways to add custom styles. It can be done from **Elementor**, using a child-theme, or with an external plugin. To customize the theme further, visit [Elementor developers docs](https://developers.elementor.com/docs/hello-elementor-theme/).
